In early childhood education, motor skill development significantly influences a child's cognitive and physical abilities. To address this, a school is initiating a groundbreaking project. Utilizing advanced machine learning, the school aims to analyze students' handwriting patterns as a potential indicator of motor skill development. The core objective is to explore if a simple writing test, involving drawing numbers, can reliably assess motor skills. Data science professionals have been engaged to build predictive models, starting with the straightforward K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach. The subsequent phase involves comparing results with more advanced models like neural networks. The project's premise is rooted in the belief that a well-trained machine learning model can not only identify drawn numbers but also offer insights into students' motor skill development. This predictive ability may empower educators to identify students needing additional support in early motor skill development. The dataset provided forms the basis for training and evaluating machine learning models. The project's success is poised to enhance the school's understanding of the link between handwriting and motor skills, fostering innovative educational strategies for young learners.
